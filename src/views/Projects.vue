        I worked with the Web Content Management team to migrate marketing
        landing pages from static markup into Magnolia CMS. Using a templates
        and creating reusable components we created a robust content management
        system that gave the marketing team the ability to create new landing
        pages quickly.

        I also worked closely and trained internal developers on best practices
        for developing Magnolia CMS. This process involved creating training
        documentaion, pair programming, and many Google hangouts calls.
