    <p>
      I have four years of experience building responsive webapps, content
      management systems and markting tools. The bulk of my experience is in the
      marketing/advertising world, where I have worked with some notable brands
      to bridge the gap between marketing and technology.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have experience with HTML,CSS/SCSS/, Javascript, jQuery, content
      management systems (Magnolia), React.js, Vue.js, templating engines
      (Handlebars, Freemarker, Jinja), build tools and task runners (Webpack,
      NPM, Gulp, Grunt) and version control (Git, Mercurial).
